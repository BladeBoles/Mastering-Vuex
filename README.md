# real-world-vue & mastering-vuex

Will be using this for the vuex tutorial also so that I don't have to repeat the setup.  Might have a few issues here and there since slots didn't work and the weird feather SVG thing had problems

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
